   - In Render dashboard, click "New" ‚Üí "Static Site"
   - Connect your GitHub repository

3. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `dist`
   - **Node Version**: 18

4. **Environment Variables** (if needed):
   - Add any environment variables in the Render dashboard

## Access Control Setup

### For Owner Access (You):
- Set `isOwner` to `true` in `src/App.tsx` (line 18)
- You'll have full edit/delete capabilities

### For Viewer Access (Others):
- The app automatically detects viewer mode
- Viewers can see all content but cannot modify anything
- Edit/delete buttons are hidden for viewers

### Making it Secure:
For production use, consider implementing:
- Authentication system (Firebase Auth, Auth0, etc.)
- Backend API for data persistence
- Role-based access control

## Data Storage

Currently, the app uses browser localStorage for data persistence. This means:
- ‚úÖ No backend required
- ‚úÖ Fast and responsive
- ‚úÖ Works offline
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data is device-specific
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data can be lost if browser data is cleared

For production use with multiple users, consider integrating:
- Firebase Firestore
- Supabase
- MongoDB Atlas
- PostgreSQL with a backend API

## Customization

### Changing Owner Information:
Edit the profile information in:
- `src/App.tsx` (profile section)
- `src/components/StatsCard.tsx` (header)

### Styling:
- Colors and themes: `tailwind.config.js`
- Component styles: Individual component files
- Global styles: `src/index.css`

### Adding Features:
The codebase is modular and well-organized:
- `src/components/`: React components
- `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions
- `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks
